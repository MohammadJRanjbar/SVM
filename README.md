# SVM
# 1- Data 
Make data in 2 categories 1 and -1 using polar coordinates so that the separation curve is a circle, for example

* Create an SVM learner with linear SVM algorithm and train data set. Calculate the classification accuracy on the test and train sets. Then draw the curve of the margins and the decision boundary, and specify the Support Vectors on it.
# 2- Iris Dataset
* one versus all
